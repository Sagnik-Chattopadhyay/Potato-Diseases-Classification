# Overview of Potato Disease Detection System

<p>
This project aims to develop an end-to-end <strong>Potato Disease Detection System</strong> using machine learning, enabling fast and accurate identification of potato leaf diseases. The system utilizes a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> model trained on leaf images to classify diseases, such as early blight and late blight, empowering farmers and agricultural experts to take proactive action. The backend server is built with <strong>FastAPI</strong> to serve the model through an API interface, integrated with <strong>TensorFlow Serving</strong> and optimized for efficient deployment using <strong>TensorFlow Lite</strong> for mobile and edge devices.
